      <h2>ROD</h2>
      <h3>1.Shimano Jodias 166M</h3>
      <p>
        Born from the home of bass fishing, we tested this rod extensively in the competitive bass fishing environment in Japan and USA.<br>
        All possible technique of bass fishing is covered in this rod by adding a "High-Power X" finish.<br>
        Guides placement and sizes are carefully chosen to maximum useability and to keep the rod weight low.<br>
        Shimano's own CI4+ fighting reel seat adds a classy touch to the rod as well as exceptional functionality.<br>

      <h3>2.NS Eldorado Generation C-682XMH</h3>
      <p>
        he strong stiffness, rarely found in major upgraded models of MH(power of rod) for bass anglers, enables even the record-setting catch to be subdued without difficulty.<br>
        This model is ideal for the lift-and-pull situations basic for the floor fishing, and provides optimal action for operation of fishing tackle such as rubber jig, Texas rig, free rig, heavy down shot, etc.<br>
        This product was designed as a model with a powerful rod blank, providing excellent maneuverability, balance, sensitivity, etc.<br><br>
